------TEKKEN BOT README (https://github.com/roguelike2d/TekkenBot/releases)------
* Launch Tekken 7, then launch Tekken Bot by clicking on TekkenBotPrime.exe. Tekken Bot should automatically locate the running Tekken 7 instance and start reading its memory.
* Frame Data Overlay requires Tekken 7 to be in windowed or windowed borderless mode (switch first to windowed, THEN to borderless).
* Users with multiple monitors can get the overlay as a seperate, draggable window on their second monitor (display -> overlay_as_draggable_window).
